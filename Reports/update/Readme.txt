1. Update by first deleting the old Libraries folder 'Data\Start_lib' from the data folder.
2. Next delete 'Data\Jre7'
3. Finally, Extract the contents of the zip file provided in to the 'data' directory on the usb. 

When the files are extracted they will replace several other files.  This is normal.  
If no files are overwritten then the update files are being put in the wrong place.

The program should start up normally at this point.
